# hippo-notify
A notification service allowing any application to send notifications to users

This is a proof of concept for now but this repository contains both serverless and cloudformation templates for creating an API gateway endpoint
connected to a lambda function which can send any email template to any user.

For full documentation on setting these up see https://hippowiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HI/pages/1796702227/Proof+of+concept+for+Hippo+Notify
